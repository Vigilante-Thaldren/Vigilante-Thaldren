# Total Annihilation

Greetings.\
I am Thaldren. 

I am the individual responsible for fixing the TA Unofficial Beta Patch 3.9.02 as of 2015+ status from 2019 to 2023. FunkyFr3sh is responsible for providing CNC-DDraw to better wrap the DDraw calls into DirectX 9+. Much thanks for his prior work.

With 25 years of historic developments, about 20 of which are post-Cavedog into Total Annihilation, I am announcing a Full Patch Rewrite from Base 3.1-1117a [ Boneyards Version ], right before Cavedog shut down.

It is my great pleasure to announce this new project after many years of Total Annihilation Developments. There are many new things to come with this Now-Announced Patch Update in the works. But in time, they are planned to be revealed.

Until next time, Commander!


Best Regards,\
Thaldren
